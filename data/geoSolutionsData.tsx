Additionally, our engine qualitifies the economic impacts the events go have individually or as a group of events happening within a geography on a specifc time period. 

How can this be used:
a. See demand forecast and its impact over time in our trend dashboard 
b. Consume data via an API to include in your internal prediction model`,
